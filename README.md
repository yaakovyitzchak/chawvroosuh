Yo

start the server with the script "node ok.js" after opening a command line in the server folder


then open the .html file in client, you can replace the maweemir text etc. and the data for the words manually for now


you can start recording a video, and a JavaScript file that records the time of the clikcking for possible future playback of the highlighting without the need for a video, to follow along with the audio

To start recording:

after opening the HTML file press Alt + ` [the key to the left of the "1" on the keyboard],

then press Alt + ` again to stop recording and download the video and JS file


First example video [An End He Set for Darkness](https://moshiach77d.blogspot.com/2021/07/youtube-video-player.html)

You can also use it without a server at all by using the #hash of the URL

To begin, go to the [Encoder](https://yaakovyitzchak.github.io/chawvroosuh/client/encoder.html)

Enter in some values for either the Maweemir itself, or both the two lower input fields, then "make" the new hash and copy it

Now, open the [Main Chavrusa file](https://yaakovyitzchak.github.io/chawvroosuh/client/chavruta.html) and paste the hash to the end of the URL, and refresh the page

Now freely add new words etc. by clicking the "Etzem" button, then when you're done simply copy the URL back into the "encoder" page, in the first input "base URL", then click the button under it

You can now modify the values manually, or copy them elsewhere, in the next two input fields

You can also copy the base URL to the [Decoder](https://yaakovyitzchak.github.io/chawvroosuh/client/decoder.html) to get a raw JSON output for later use
